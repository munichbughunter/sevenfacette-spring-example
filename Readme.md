# 7Facette Spring JVM demo

## Local build
You need to build the core package and deploy it to local maven repository:
`gradle clean build -x test`
`gradle clean build publishtomavenlocal`
Then you can use SevenFacette as local dependency and try it on your own

## Demo environment for Http Client Tests
For http tests use the restful booker:
